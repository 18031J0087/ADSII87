greedy algortihm:
1) This searches all the solutions and chooses the best one.
2) there is no memorization.
3) no sub problem division.
4) problems are locally optimised.

dynamic programing:
1) problems are overally optimized
2) here problems are divided into subproblems and solved
3) finally they are combined to form a bigger solution.
4) use of memorization is done.

3)
ANS. the time complexity of the code is O(nXm).
